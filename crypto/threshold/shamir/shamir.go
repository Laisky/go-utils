// Package shamir is Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing is a method for
// dividing a secret into multiple parts and distributing those parts among
// different participants. This ensures that only authorized parties can access the secret.
//
// The method involves randomly generating n parts, each of which is
// completely independent of the other parts and contains
// no information about the original secret. An integer threshold k is
// specified such that the original secret can only be
// reconstructed when k or more parts are combined together.
//
// Each participant holds one part of the secret and can only access
// the original secret when they combine their part with at
// least k-1 other parts. This method provides high security, as even if
// some of the participants are compromised, they will
// only have access to a partial key, and cannot reconstruct the original secret.
